A public dashboard is a web-based platform or application that displays data and information in a visual format for public consumption. These dashboards are often used by organizations, government agencies, and businesses to share important data, metrics, and information with a wider audience. Here are some key points to consider when discussing public dashboards:

### Purpose:

Public dashboards serve various purposes, such as providing transparency, improving communication, and enabling data-driven decision-making.
They are used in different sectors, including healthcare, education, government, finance, and more.


Accessibility:

Public dashboards are designed to be easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
They are often optimized for both desktop and mobile devices to reach a wider audience.
Examples:

Government agencies may use public dashboards to share COVID-19 statistics, budget information, or crime data with the public.
Businesses can create public dashboards to showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) or customer satisfaction metrics.
Educational institutions may use public dashboards to provide insights into student performance and enrollment data.
Benefits:

Improved transparency: Public dashboards promote transparency by making data accessible to the public, which can lead to greater trust.
Informed decision-making: Public stakeholders can make informed decisions based on the data presented in these dashboards.
Accountability: Organizations can be held accountable for their performance and actions when data is publicly available.
